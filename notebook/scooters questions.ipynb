    "1. During this period, seven companies offered scooters. How many scooters did each company have in this time frame? Did the number for each company change over time? Did scooter usage vary by company?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. According to Second Substitute Bill BL2018-1202 (as amended) (https://web.archive.org/web/20181019234657/https://www.nashville.gov/Metro-Clerk/Legislative/Ordinances/Details/7d2cf076-b12c-4645-a118-b530577c5ee8/2015-2019/BL2018-1202.aspx), all permitted operators will first clean data before providing or reporting data to Metro. Data processing and cleaning shall include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Removal of staff servicing and test trips\n",
    "* Removal of trips below one minute\n",
    "* Trip lengths are capped at 24 hours\n",
    "\n",
    "Are the scooter companies in compliance with the second and third part of this rule?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The goal of Metro Nashville is to have each scooter used a minimum of 3 times per day. Based on the data, what is the average number of trips per scooter per day? Make sure to consider the days that a scooter was available. How does this vary by company? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is the highest count of scooters being used at the same time? When did it occur? Does this vary by zip code or other geographic region? 4. SUMDs can provide alternative transportation and provide \"last mile\" access to public transit. How often are trips starting near public transit hubs? You can download a dataset of bus stop locations from https://data.nashville.gov/Transportation/Regional-Transportation-Authority-Bus-Stops/p886-fnbd."
